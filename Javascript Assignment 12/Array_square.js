/*Write a JavaScript program to iterate over an array inputted by the user using
mapping. Perform the square of all elements in the original array, store the
squares in a new array and make a mapping for the squares and display it.
Sample Input:
[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
Explanation:
Original Array = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
New Array = [ 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 ]
Mapping = squares => [ 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 ]
Output:
[ 1, 4, 9, 16, 25 ]*/

var arr=[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
var new_arr=arr.map((value)=>{
    return value*value;
})
console.log(new_arr)
