Are Higher Order functions and Call back functions the same ? If not,briefly explain about both functions.

Both Higher Order functions and Call back functions are different.

Higher order functions are functions that operate on other functions,
A Higher-Order function is a function that receives a function as an argument or returns the function as output.
Functions such as filter(),map(),reduce(),some() etc, these all are example of Higher-Order Functions

A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.
Note, however, that callbacks are often used to continue code execution after an asynchronous operation has completed these are called asynchronous callbacks. 
A good example is the callback functions executed inside a .then() block chained onto the end of a promise after that promise fulfills or rejects. 
This structure is used in many modern web APIs, such as fetch().

The numbers function below is a higher order function that takes callback function as araguments.

Example:
function add(x, y){
  return x + y;
}
function numbers(fn, x, y){
  return fn(x, y);
}
var addResult = numbers(add, 3, 2);
console.log(addResult)
